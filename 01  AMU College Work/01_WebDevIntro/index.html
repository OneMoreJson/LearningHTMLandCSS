      <h4>We Roast our Own Beans!</h4>
        <p>
          Our coffee comes from all over the world.  Depending on the season, we might get beans from Colombia, Kona, Mexico, Guatemala or any other wonderful fair-trade plantation.  This month, we have an <span class="italictext">Organic Honduran Marcala </span>that is incredible when lightly roasted.  The subtle chocolate flavor pairs wonderfully with our pumkin spice cheesecake.  If you are wanting something to put a bit more hair on your paladin’s chest, we recommend the <span class="italictext">Jamaican Blue Mountain</span>.  Roasted dark and served with rich cream, this earthy brew is seriously strong and bold.

        <h4>We Love Games!</h4>
        <p>
          Come by and feel free to play a game of cards, chess or any number of our stocked board games.  Just a warning though, we really love D&D.  You could say things get a little rowdy past 6 P.M.  We have a come-as-you-are nights every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  However Thursday through Friday are D&D adventure leagues with dedicated Dungeon Masters (DMs).  You’ll want to sign up as the tables fill up quickly.

        <h4>Letter from Michelle...</h4>
        <p>
          Hi, I use to be a closet D&D gamer.  My character is a level 14 half elf mage named Rocky.  I also really love coffee.  One day I was looking for a place to buy some freshly roasted coffee when I came across C&G online.  When I visited, the people here were supper kind.   The barista gave me a free drink when I bought a bag of their coffee of the month, <span class="italictext">Dark Rouges Caffeine.</span>  I also found a new figurine for my character.  I didn’t even know they sell all sorts of D&D gaming stuff.  This place is amazing!  I feel like I finally found a place I belong!
