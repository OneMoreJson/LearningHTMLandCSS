# Linkedin Learning : Web Dev Front In Lessons

## Admin 

### 2020 12 25 : 1251 || Admin Org
I archiving some of the repo and reorganizing my folders.  I found that while I am completing lesson plans on subjects, I have things organized in my local drives focused on where I get the training rather than the subject.  However, I want to keep my repos down, so I think I should focus on subject and then the learning organization I get the training.  This probably doesn’t mean anything to anyone, but I think right now would be a good time to adjust everything so I can focus on what matters… learning the skills and information.

#### Moved “LI Learning : Web Dev Front End Lessons” under the title of “Study HTML/CSS.”  This way I can add other things I’m learning from different sources without opening a new repo.

### 2020 12 131830 : 0930 || LI 10
I’m going to need to find a better class on JS.  This guy is kind of hard to follow.   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2020 12 12 : 0930 || LI 10
I am starting with chapter 3: working with data.  Variables.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2020 12 07 : 0730 || Lesson 10
Worked in this course.  I won’t be able to continue later as I have a ton of real world life stuff!  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LI 10 … JavaScript Essential Training

### 2020 12 06 : 1000 || Lesson 10 
Started the initial videos.  I also, later, downloaded the content and structured my folders to continue this lesson.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2020 12 05 : 0900 || Lesson 09
First, I find it rather frustrating that I try to maintain a syntax structure when uploading my readme files.  Then I look down and several things were not correctly written.  I’m the one trying to follow the self-made rules and there I go, getting them mixed up.  Alright, rant over.
Working on LI L 09, HTML Structure, Syntax and Semantics.  I left off at the section 02, Structures and footers. Competed the lesson.  Need to save this

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LI 09 … HTML5 Structure Syntax And Semantics

### 2020 11 30 : 2100 || Lesson 09
Preparing to do a 3 hour (more in-depth) course on LI.  I’m hoping to pick up some things that make this work better in my head.  Best practices and building better foundations in HTML5. Also, I am hoping to better understand how I can make accessible code for people who have special visual and hearing needs.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2020 11 30 : 1350 || Lesson 07
Finally completed.  This was both a lot more than I needed for the class, while also only touching the surface of what we could do.  It was a good class.  I need to learn JS next.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2020 11 29 : 0900 || Lesson 07
Continued Lesson.  Did not complete.  Need to continue tomorrow.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LI 07 … HTML Video and Audio
## LI 08 … HTML Web Programming Foundations

### 2020 11 28 : 0700 || Lesson 07 
Started Lesson.  Ended up completing Lesson 08.
#### 1200 | Lesson 08
Started and completed Lesson 08.  It was about 40 minutes of video.  Most educational part about the lesson was how the DOM and Nodes work together.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 11 27 : 1210 || Readme
Reorganized all readme entries.  I placed everything in a Scrivener document.  The idea is to write here, in a wordprocessing application.  It will help me check my spelling.  It will also provide a backup for all work.  Finally, when the day is over and I’m uploading into GH, I will have everything I did through the day written here…I only need to copy and paste.  
Another thing I wanted to do before the Readme files became overwhelmingly large.  I wanted the file to read backwards.  You should read what is recent at the beginning of the document.  If you want to follow what came before, scroll and it should be easy to see.  Finally, I created lines to break apart days.  Sometimes you will have titles, subtitles with the day, and sub-sub titles with the time.  These needed to be “blocked” in a manner that is less confusing than continuing to look to see what day you are on.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LI 06 ... HTML Forms

### 2020 11 24 : 1500 || Start & Finish Lesson
I started this lesson because it works well with Week 05's Web Dev Lesson in AMU.  However, the instructor was so terribly sad I just finished the lesson for the cert.  I'll be using reference because things can change.  Also, this lesson was kind of old.  She did stuff that didn't make sense. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LI 05 ... HTML Tables

### 2020 11 21 : 1500 || Begin Lesson
I started this lesson because it works well with AMU's Web Dev Intro Week 04 assignment.  I expect I will learn more than I need for the class.  Still, that is what I'm looking for.  Completed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LI 04 ... Succeeding In Web Development

### 2020 11 20 : 1300 || Begin and Complete
This is a class that explains all the parts of becomeing a Web Dev and what one should be able to do and provide the community.  I need to rewatch this and take extensive notes.  The instructor listed off a ton of resources.  It would be easy to flail and try to do and know everything AT ONCE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2020 11 18 : 2000 || HTML Meta Tag Course
Learning about meta tags inside the head of an HTML document.  See the Notion Notes on this course for reminders. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2020 11 17 : 1600 || Restart Folders
I was trying fix the connection between the desktop folders and the online GH.  That was my work for today.

#### 1630 | GH Problems
Why does GH not add my uploads to the Repo towards caclulating my activity?  Lets try this.  
#### 1956 | Completed Lesson
Completed the Lesson.  I am still trying to figure out the workflow
#### 2107 | Next Class Ready
Changed the folders to keep all the Linked In lessons for Front End.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LI 03 ... Crafting Meaningful HTML

### 2020 11 08 : 1500 || Start Course
This is the 2nd LI course I've taken...I'm combining it into the GH workflow to max my learning
